DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides an interface to the Ingenico Online Credit Verification 
Server (OCV) (see http://www.ingenico.com.au). The OCV server provides an 
interface into the bank network and allows credit card transactions to be
processed in real-time.

Usage:

# create a connection to the OCV server
$ocv = new OCV
(
	Server   => '192.1.2.3:53005', 
	ClientID => 'MyClient', 
	Account  => '1',
);

# process a purchase transaction (amount is in cents)
if ($m = $ocv->purchase(CardNum=>'4...3' CardExpiry=>'0202', Amount=>'1000'))
{
  warn "Warning: $@" if $@;
  print "Purchase result: " . $m->Result . "\n";
}
else
{
  warn "Error: $@";
}

The interface is complete, including
 - full logging
 - internal totals support
 - polled mode support
 - all transaction types (purchase, refund, pre-auth, completion, status)
 - statistics
 - VPP configuration and status
 - account list
 - server totals

The only thing missing is complete support for 'logons', as Ingenico state 
this is deprecated as a client request.

TODO
----

- update and convert documentation to pod form

FUTURE WORK
-----------

- Add support for shared server connections
- Implement a Business::OnlinePayment interface
- Add support for logging to a DBI backend
